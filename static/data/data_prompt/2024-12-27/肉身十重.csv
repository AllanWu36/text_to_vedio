In the early morning mist still lingering over ""Wan Xiang Garden"", a family manor house belonging to the powerful Fang family, a group of young sons of the Fang clan gathered for their daily martial arts training and morning exercise.

The picture would depict a serene and tranquil atmosphere, with the misty dawn slowly lifting off the garden's stone pathways. The young men, dressed in traditional Chinese clothing, would be shown performing various martial arts moves, such as push-ups, squats, and stretches, while maintaining a focus on their breathing and posture. Their movements would be fluid and synchronized, conveying a sense of discipline and dedication to their craft.

In the background, the lush greenery of the garden would provide a picturesque contrast to the physical intensity of the training session. The sound of soft chimes or wind instruments might add a subtle musical element to the scene, underscoring the harmony between nature and human activity.","NSFW,sketches, (worst quality:2), (low quality:2), (normal quality:2), lowres, normal quality, ((monochrome)), ((grayscale)), skin spots, acnes, skin blemishes, bad anatomy,(long hair:1.4),DeepNegative,(fat:1.2),facing away, looking away,tilted head, {Multiple people}, lowres,bad anatomy,bad hands, text, error, missing fingers,extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, worstquality, low quality, normal quality,jpegartifacts,signature, watermark, username,blurry,bad feet,cropped,poorly drawn hands,poorly drawn face,mutation,deformed,worst quality,low quality,normal quality,jpeg artifacts,signature,watermark,extra fingers,fewer digits,extra limbs,extra arms,extra legs,malformed limbs,fused fingers,too many fingers,long neck,cross-eyed,mutated hands,polar lowres,bad body,bad proportions,gross proportions,text,error,missing fingers,missing arms,missing legs,extra digit, extra arms, extra leg, extra foot,"

Here's a description of the scene:

The painting depicts a majestic landscape with a large, imposing castle in the center. The castle is surrounded by lush greenery and towering trees, with a serene lake reflecting the sky above.

In front of the castle stands a regal figure, dressed in formal attire, holding a staff and wearing a dignified expression. This is General Wang (方家), the lord of the estate, who serves as the Governor-General of Dragon Spring Province.

To the side of General Wang stands a younger version of himself, dressed in traditional clothing from the Han Dynasty (specifically, during the time of Emperor Wu). This represents his ancestor, who was part of the legendary ""Ten Great Sects"" of the Flying Butterfly Path, a prestigious martial arts organization from ancient China.

In the background, there's a subtle hint of the Chinese countryside, with winding roads and towering mountains. The atmosphere is peaceful and serene, evoking a sense of history and tradition.

大离王朝建国之后本来要定都在这里，但是因为龙渊之地水气太重，最终放弃了定都的想法,3,"best quality,masterpiece,illustration, an extremely delicate and beautiful,extremely detailed,CG,unity,8k wallpaper, 根据给出的内容，可以描述如下的一副画面：

一幅古老而majestic的画面，背景是一个蓝色的天空，中间有一个大型的城墙，城墙上写着“龙渊之地”。

在城墙内，有一个广阔的城市景象，显示了成千上万个人的生活场景。

但是，画面中的水气和雹点在飞舞着，让整个城都处于湿度丰富的环境中。

最右下角的一个大型的字体上写着“龙渊之地”，而左边的一个小型的字体上写着“计划要定都这里”。

被水压制，不宜定都在龙渊，所以才定都在南方的“离京”,5,"best quality,masterpiece,illustration, an extremely delicate and beautiful,extremely detailed,CG,unity,8k wallpaper, 🎨 🌴

Here's a description of the scene:

The painting depicts a majestic dragon (or ""long"" in Chinese) emerging from a lake or river, with water pressure exerted on its body. The dragon is shown to be constrained by the force of the water, unable to move forward.

In the background, a city or a settlement can be seen, with buildings and towers made of traditional Chinese materials like wood and tile. However, there's a subtle hint that this isn't the primary city, but rather a secondary one located in the south (or ""nán fā"" in Mandarin).

The painting conveys the idea that the dragon's power is so great that it can't be contained within a single location, let alone a specific city like Longyong. Instead, its presence is felt throughout the region, making it impractical to establish a permanent capital.

The title of the artwork could be: ""Dragon's Power Constrained by Water Pressure""
